# Chapter 1 — Darkness and Light

The wind whispers through the air as rain falls from the sky, each droplet guided by the breeze, landing gently on the soil beneath us all. A figure—a tall figure—walks within the soothing rain. With each step he takes, the puddles tremble, splashing as if children were playing. If only it were children... and not **HIM**.

The figure walks among the streets of a desolate village. Who **HE**—had laid waste upon. His reason of doing so were never clear… perhaps they could never be explained. The figure looks around the area, as if he were a terminator, sent to bring upon the extinction of the planet Akon. He looks around, carefully scanning the area for any form of life. Walking and walking, the figure continued to search, every corner and every part of the planet. 

In a crumbling but still standing cellar, a family of 4, the last remaining Akonians, hid in total silence. As they dare not to make even the slightest sound, as they fear, **HE** might hear them. The family heard the loud footsteps coming from above the cellar, they held their breaths, hoping he would leave. The footsteps grew louder and louder, sweat began to run down the heads of the family, they covered their mouths, fearing for the worst. They closed their eyes, trying to relax themselves from the tension, sooner or later, the footsteps gotten lighter and lighter, until the point where there were no more footsteps to be heard, **HE** had left the area. 

The family let out a sigh of relief, the father carefully poked his head out of the cellar entrance to check if the area was clear, once he had made sure, he brought his family out of the cellar and towards a Beta Pod to escape the planet as it was no longer safe. The family got out of the cellar and began moving towards the Pod Bay, located near an underground bunker. The path to the bunker was quite a distance, but they had to try, to survive. 

Moments passed, they got to where the bunker is located at. Right as when they felt a sense of joy, their smiles were soon wiped away by the sound a footsteps coming from behind them. The father turned around, his eyes widened, sweat slowly running down his head. And there the father saw, int he great distance, **HIM—**the most feared being of the entirety of Dimension X, whose name is never dared to be said out loud; whose presence so terrifying, even cosmic beings are brought their knees, a being of true nightmare. 

His body was covered in scars—with each being a reminder of the battles he fought when he first arrived at Dimension X, none of which could claim his life. His muscles were denser, harder than any known mineral in the entirety of Dimension X. He wore no shirt, only ragged, dirt-stained pants that clung to him like remnants of a past long forgotten.  His eyes remained hidden behind a tattered blindfold, worn with age. Though blindfolded, he could still see—not with sight, but through a power known as True Sight, allowing him to perceive the lingering energy within every soul. He could hear the world through the planet itself: the vibration of every footstep, every breath, every heartbeat—he felt it all through the ground beneath him.

His name… was Zorrath, The Wanderer of X.

Standing beyond them, Zorrath did not make a move, he was just…standing there, or so they thought he was. Once the father blinked, he realizes it was already too late, he was fast, faster than light. His speed was so absolute—that only blinking, could the mind begin to process his where he was. But by that point, it was already too late to do anything, Zorrath raises his hand, ready to finish them off with a slow and painful death of incineration by touch. Before his hand manages to be placed onto the father’s chest, they disappeared into thin air, at first Zorrath was confused, then he felt another presence within the planet. He turned his gaze towards the side, The family of four stood still, shocked by what had just occurred. And beside them…

A figure in a black robe stood between Zorrath and the family. Zorrath grinned. He immediately knew who the figure was. 

“So… you’ve returned once again to try and kill me?”

The figure stood silent for a moment, then turned slightly to the family.
“Go.”

They hesitated at first, but his calming voice gave them a sense of trust, and courage to run.
“Thank you,” the mother whispered, and the family ran toward the bunker.

Zorrath didn’t move. He didn’t care about the family anymore.
His attention was fully locked on the robed figure standing before him.  The figure showed no fear, no means to escape. 

“This will be your 139th attempt trying to stop me. Don’t you ever get tired of repeating this over and over again?” Zorrath said, rolling his shoulders from side to side, loosening his body. He cracked his neck, then his knuckles—one after the other.

The figure did the same, cracking his knuckles in sync with Zorrath, as if to taunt him into battle. 

"It doesn't matter how many I’ve already died. I'll keep coming back... until I kill you. For good.”

“Well then, let’s see if this is your last attempt,” Zorrath said, dropping into a stance. Planting his left foot into the soft mud, then slowly slid it back, carving a shallow groove behind him… One fist drew back, while the other hovered in front.

The figure too got into his stance, creating a small carve within the mud with his right foot.. Clenching his right hand into a fist, while the other left relaxed in front of him—ready to strike or block at any given point.

The standoff dragged on, tension crackling in the air as both fighters prepared to strike. Neither moved—until Zorrath’s patience finally snapped.

Zorrath dashed toward the figure, launching a fierce jump kick. The figure didn’t dodge—he blocked the strike head-on. With Zorrath still suspended in the air for a brief moment, vulnerable, the figure struck. His fist landed cleanly on a vital point in Zorrath’s torso, the hit sharp and precise.

The blow sent Zorrath flying several meters back, tumbling across the ground before he managed to catch himself. He spat out a small splash of blood and wiped his mouth with the back of his right hand. 

"Not bad… It’s been a long time since anyone’s made me bleed. This is going to be interesting.”

Their battle raged on—strike after strike, each collision echoing like thunder across the land. Fist met fist, kick met kick, neither giving an inch. They fought relentlessly, a storm of fury and precision. Blood was spilled, but neither paused to feel the pain. The pain only fueled them instead. 

Their battle raged on—strike after strike, each collision echoing like thunder across the land. Fist met fist, kick met kick, neither giving an inch. They fought relentlessly, a storm of fury and precision. Blood was spilled, but neither paused to feel the pain.

The pain only fueled them.

Their clash tore through the battlefield—first on the ground, shaking the very planet beneath them, then soaring into the sky, where fists flew faster than lightning. From craters to clouds, they waged war without rest.

While clashing amidst the stormy sky, the figure caught a glimpse of movement below—the family was still running. They hadn’t escaped. The bunker’s pods had been destroyed.

His heart sank.

Now, mid-battle with Zorrath, he was forced to split his focus. He couldn’t let his guard down… but he also couldn’t let the family die.

He would have to fight—and protect them at the same time.

But in that single moment of distraction, Zorrath struck.

A crushing blow struck toward the figure’s torso, the force so brutal it shattered his rib cage, forcing blood to burst from his mouth. Before he could recover, Zorrath followed with a violent grab and hurled him downward, slamming him through the air like a meteor. The sky cracked with thunder as his body plummeted, crashing into the earth below with a thunderous impact.

From the force of the collision, the figure’s tattered robe tore free, fluttering through the air like a broken flag, while his cracked mask was sent flying in the opposite direction, spinning across the battlefield before shattering against a jagged rock.

Zorrath then turned toward the family and shot forward like a missile, his body cutting through the air. His right fist clenched tightly, his left arm aimed dead at the family—he was seconds away from delivering the finishing blow.

The father looked back and screamed, throwing himself in front of his loved ones, shielding them with his body as best as he could.

Suddenly, time itself seemed to freeze.

For just three seconds, everything stopped—rain suspended midair, thunder paused in the clouds. The figure, bloodied but not broken, reappeared in a blur. In that moment, he rushed in from the side, and with all his strength, delivered a brutal right hook to the side of Zorrath’s face.

Time snapped back.

Zorrath’s head whipped sideways from the impact, his momentum shattered as he was sent flying off course, crashing into a distant hillside.

The figure hovered in place, panting lightly. His robe, torn from the earlier impact, now lay scattered across the battlefield. His mask—once hiding his face—was gone, revealing his true form.

And in that moment, the family’s relief twisted into dread.

They stared at him, wide-eyed, frozen in place.

Because the man who had just saved them…

looked exactly like Zorrath.

Same build. Same features. Same scars.

But the key difference… was his presence.

It didn’t radiate fear or death. Instead, it felt like hope—like the presence of a protector.
His eyes were weary, one sealed shut by an old scar—inflicted long ago by a creature deep within Dimension X.

He turned toward the family once more and shouted, “RUN!”

The father hurriedly scooped up his youngest son, fleeing with his wife and daughter toward the hidden bunker, praying an escape pod still remained.

The figure glanced back.

Zorrath was rising—slowly, but surely—rage etched into every movement.

The figure clenched his jaw, then rocketed forward, slamming into Zorrath mid-rise. With a roar, he dragged him across the ground, dirt and stone erupting in their path. He yanked Zorrath upward and slammed a brutal punch into his face, sending him hurtling across the land.

Not letting up, the figure shot behind him—delivering a fierce kick to Zorrath’s back that launched him skyward. Before Zorrath could regain control, the figure reappeared in front of him, twisting mid-air to deliver a devastating spinning heel kick.

Boom!

Zorrath’s body crashed back onto the planet, exploding into the ground with a thunderous impact, forming a massive crater.

Without a pause, the figure dove after him at blinding speed, both fists clenched and aimed forward.

He struck Zorrath’s chest with full force—an impact that cracked the land beneath, widening the crater and shaking the very soil of Planet Akon. 

The figure continued his relentless assault, fists flying in a blur. He hammered Zorrath with a flurry of blows, each one echoing like thunder, refusing to give him even a breath to recover.

And then—something changed.

In the midst of his barrage, the figure opened what was thought to be his sealed-shut left eye.

A faint, otherworldly light began to pour from it—white and pure, trailing like mist as it flowed gently to the side. The energy from it crackled softly, illuminating the storm around them.

That eye—scarred long ago by a creature deep within Dimension X—was no ordinary eye. It had been gifted, or cursed, with the power of True Sight.

And now, open once again, it revealed something no mortal could ever perceive: the shifting, vulnerable threads of a soul. Vital points glowed faintly within Zorrath—marks invisible to the naked eye, but now fully exposed to the figure’s gaze.

He struck with renewed precision, each hit targeting something deeper than flesh and bone.

But fury burns hotter than pain.

Zorrath’s rage boiled over.

He caught one of the punches mid-air—his grip tightening. With a sickening crack, he snapped the figure’s arm sideways like it was nothing more than a twig.

The figure didn’t scream.

Even as his right arm hung limp and shattered, he gritted his teeth and raised his left to block Zorrath’s next strike. But Zorrath was faster—too fast.

His fist slammed into the figure’s gut with brutal force.

The impact folded him in half, sending him hurtling across the battlefield like a broken missile. He crashed into the ground, bouncing and skidding before finally coming to a stop at the very edge of the bunker.

Dirt and debris rained down around him.

He spat blood out, staining the dirt beneath him—but he wasn’t done.

Gritting his teeth, he turned to the side, trembling slightly as he planted his good arm against the ground. With a strained breath, he pushed himself up, rising slowly.

Broken… but not beaten.

His one open eye locked back onto Zorrath—now glowing faintly—burning with the same defiance as before.

“Enough of this,” Zorrath growled.

He rocketed into the sky like a bolt of crimson lightning, thunder cracking behind him. As he rose above the clouds, his body began to pulse—surging with raw, unchecked energy.

High above the battlefield, he extended both arms outward, summoning power from the very fabric of Dimension X. The skies darkened as a blinding orb of energy began to form between his palms. It crackled violently, expanding rapidly, its core swirling with searing white-hot plasma and flickers of deep violet flame.

The concentrated force was immense—so dense and unstable that space itself began to ripple around it. The energy radiating from the sphere was as hot as a sun—maybe hotter. The clouds surrounding him ignited into vapor, vanishing into the void.

Zorrath’s voice boomed across the land like the wrath of a god.

“If I keep feeding it… it’ll decimate this universe. And the next.”

Below, the figure remained still, battered and bloodied. Wind and pressure swirled around him, pulling at his torn clothes and scattering debris in every direction. His eye—his one open eye—still burned with defiance.

But then he noticed something—something that made his blood run cold.

The family hadn’t escaped.

They were still at the pod, struggling to reconfigure the controls. Their hands moved frantically over the interface, trying to override damaged systems, panic rising with each failed attempt.

And above them, Zorrath’s energy sphere was being conjured at an alarming rate—far faster than anything the figure had ever seen before.

He didn’t have minutes.

He had seconds.

His mind raced. He had to move.

If he didn’t act now…

All he did would be useless.

All the pain, the blood, the sacrifice—meaningless.

His broken body screamed in protest, but he forced it forward.

One breath. One step.

One chance. That was was all he had.

Zorrath hurled the energy sphere toward the planet without hesitation.

The skies screamed as the devastating mass tore downward, space itself warping around its descent.

The figure looked up.

No time.

With a sudden breath, he slammed his shoulder back into place—bones snapping into position. His shattered arm surged with energy, mending as if never broken. Muscles flexed. Blood evaporated from his wounds.

He wasn't done.

Not yet.

Spreading his arms out wide beneath the falling death above him, he gathered what little strength he had left. Raw energy spiraled around him, his tattered cloak whipping in the growing storm. He slid his left leg behind him for balance, planting his stance into the ground like a final anchor.

His right arm swept upward in a slow, counterclockwise motion—channeling every fragment of power into his core.

The family was still trapped, still trying to reconfigure the pod.

There wasn’t enough time.

But he would make time.

The light around him intensified, his entire body glowing from within as energy surged to his hands. With a final cry, he thrust both palms forward—left hand open and upside down beneath, right hand upright above it—funneling everything into one concentrated burst.

“Repulsion Wave!!” he roared.

A titanic beam erupted from his palms—a column of pure white-blue light, blinding and divine. The blast shot upward, colliding with Zorrath’s falling energy sphere mid-air.

BOOOOM!

The collision ignited the sky in a cataclysmic flash. The shockwave that followed could be heard for miles—a deafening, godlike thunder that split the heavens.

The figure gritted his teeth, pouring every last ounce of energy into the wave. The pressure crushed against him, the force threatening to tear him apart. But he held firm, knowing—He was never meant to leave this planet.

But the family still could.

If he was going to die…

He’d die stopping the impossible.

He’d die saving them.

The figure’s energy wave manages to hold the sphere in place—just for a moment.

But then Zorrath raised his arms again, his grin twisted with cruel delight.

He began **feeding** it more energy.

The sphere pulsed, growing larger… hotter… wilder.

The skies cracked.

The planet trembled.

But the figure did not waver.

Instead of backing down, he **roared**, summoning everything he had left and **unleashing an even greater blast**, pouring his very soul into the beam. The ground beneath him shattered, and cracks of light surged across the battlefield as he fought to hold it—**not to win**, but to buy time.

Time for the family still trapped below.

Still trying to escape the universe.

He refused to fall now.

High above, Zorrath sneered.

“Your struggle is pointless,” he spat, as the sphere swelled with power, now radiating energy that tore holes into the fabric of reality itself.

But the figure didn’t listen.

To be precise—he refused to.

Because long ago—millennia ago—he had made a promise.

And he would keep that promise, even if it meant death.

The struggle raged on.

Zorrath poured more energy into the sphere, feeding it with monstrous power. The figure, broken and exhausted, held his ground—his energy beam colliding with the growing sun of destruction. Their clash shook the heavens.

One minute.

That’s how long it lasted.

But that one minute…Was enough.

The pod behind him sparked to life, its engines roaring.

The family was gone—they’d escaped.

The figure sensed it.

And he smiled.

They would live.

With that, he slowly lowered his stance, the energy around him flickering like a dying flame. He closed his eyes and began to chant—a forbidden spell he had learned long ago on his journey through Dimension X.

In a whisper that grew to a voice carried by the wind:

"ZOA
YIQEW
ZEN
PEON
AL
KIN
YUN…"

The sphere surged forward, inching closer.
But he didn’t stop.

"PA
TEW
QEW
GUS
JAEL
ZOMA
SAKURVA…"

His strength was failing.

The energy sphere roared, unstoppable now, pushing past his fading resistance. The sky shattered into void.

"WERT
VERTY
HUE…"

He was losing ground fast—feet skidding back, body trembling. The sphere loomed over him like a god’s judgment.

"TEX
LAT
XIN
DOY
REM…"

Then—impact.

The sphere crashed into the planet with cataclysmic force, engulfing the figure in blinding light.

And yet—he did not scream.

As his body began to break apart into glowing fragments, he spoke the final words:

"QUE
ESTOKA…"

And then—softly, one last word:

"RETURN."

His body disintegrated into nothingness, his atoms swept away in the blast.

The planet beneath him collapsed—folding in on itself, consumed by the raw force of the sphere.

Zorrath had already flown into space, hovering in the silent vacuum, arms crossed as he held his breath and watched. The world below cracked, trembled—then imploded entirely, birthing a colossal black hole.

Its gravitational pull twisted the fabric of reality. Stars bent. Light shattered. Time itself faltered.

The universe began to collapse.

And still, Zorrath gazed—not at the destruction, but into the emptiness of space. Toward the direction the family had fled. He could have followed. He could have hunted them down in seconds. But he didn’t. Their escape was part of something bigger.

“Another disappointment…” he muttered.

Then, a faint smirk.

“But next time… next time, my plan will work.
And I hope you’ll meet the requirement…
Jake.”

With a surge of power, he vanished—piercing through the cosmic veil, flying toward another universe...

As the one behind him crumble into absolute nothingness.

Now comes the question—what was the figure chanting for? Was it for luck? For power? For strength to endure the blast?

No. None of those.

The ancient chant was never meant to protect the body—it was a ritual of transcendence.

It sent his mind and soul into another version of himself, a younger self, living in an alternate reality, in the form of a dream.

The spell always returns you to the day it all began. The beginning of something far greater—far more terrifying.
